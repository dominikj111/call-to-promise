# What is it?
Library offers to create callback functions and connect it by unique id descriptor with the promise object.

# How to use it?
Just call `successfn` function to get callback and a successor.

- example -

function open(arg1, arg2, promiser.successfn('w.1'), promiser.failfn('w.1'))





test for repeat fail and success -> should throw an exception
